A small project for hackaTUM-covid19
=================================
VentMonitor uses ventilator data provided by [openVent](https://www.theopenvent.com) to monitor ventilators, raise warning of patients situation and help fight covid-19.

Data(Expired C02, Expired O2, pressure, breath frequency, etc) from [the openvent api](https://api.theopenvent.com/) are presented by [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) on a webpage. We also predicted the trend of the data.
