Inspiration

Increase efficiency and alertness of docters and nurses on the IC.
What it does

    Provide an overview of the status of the patients for the docters and nurses
    Observe the data of each ventilation system online.
    Provide allerts to the docters and nurses if a situation changes.

How we built it

    retrieve data from the API and store it in a storage
    retrieve data from the storage and display it on an HTML with JS
    create predictions for each patients that can then trigger alarms

Challenges we ran into

    creating a website that is linked with other websites
    simulation of data

Accomplishments that we're proud of

    creating the webpages

What we learned

    retrieve data from a datastorage and display it in an HTML file

What's next for VentMonitor

    improve the prediction based on RNN/LSTM neural network
    creating alerts on the overview HTML
    creating buttons on the patient HMTL where the docter can decide which values he want to be alerted for, and which upper/lower bounds he wants to have for each patient
