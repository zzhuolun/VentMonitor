3. Questions about monotoring with ventilation systems:
   -> What kind of parameters are you looking at when monitoring a person?
   -> Which parameters determine the safety of the patient
   -> What are the limits (upper/lower bound) of the parameters?
   -> What are the normal values of the parameters?
   -> What is the maximum duration of a certain value?
   -> What are the meaning of the parameters?
      mve, RR, VT, PEEP















Ventilation: 
It is the process of moving air in and out of the lungs. 
Its most important effect is the removal of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
from the body, not on increasing blood oxygen content.


RR: respiratory rate -> number of breaths you take per minut (bpm)
                     -> depends on age and on activity (>= 12years: 12-16 bpm)
VT: tidal volume     -> amount of air inhaled/exhaled in each breath (during rest)
                     -> long protective ventilation strategy: 6-8 mL/kg body weight

Minute Ventilation = TV * RR



Lung protective ventilation strategy, namely low tidal volume (6-8ml/kg of ideal body weight) 
and low level of airway platform pressure (<30cmH 2 O) should be used to perform mechanical 
ventilation to reduce ventilator-related lung injury. 

PEEP: positive end-expiratory pressure
The positive pressure that will remain in the airways at the end of the respiratory cycle
-> high PEEP can be used to keep the airway warm and moist

Lung-protective ventilation principles using more physiological tidal volumes, 
avoiding high inspiratory plateau pressures, along with appropriate levels of 
positive end-expiratory pressure have been shown to decrease pulmonary complications 
and improve outcomes in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome 
requiring ongoing ventilatory support in the ICU

3.2.3 Invasive mechanical ventilation: Lung protective ventilation strategy, namely low 
tidal volume (6-8ml/kg of ideal body weight) and low level of airway platform pressure 
(<30cmH 2 O) should be used to perform mechanical ventilation to reduce ventilator-related 
lung injury. While the airway platform pressure maintained  â‰¤30cmH 2 O, high PEEP can 
be used to keep the airway warm and moist; avoid long sedation and wake the patient early 
for  lung  rehabilitation.  There  are  many  cases  of  human-machine  asynchronization, 
therefore sedation and muscle relaxants should be used in a timely manner. Use closed 
sputum  suction  according  to  the  airway  secretion,  if  necessary,  administer  appropriate 
treatment based on bronchoscopy findings.
